This Dank-a$$ Server/Client is brought to your proudly by your local networking team

To Compile:
Use the makefile! Remember to clean before you push!

To Run:
  Server:
    Use the command "./Server <port>"
  Client:
    Use the command "./Client <IP> <port>"
    <port> needs to match the port used in the server
    <IP> can be replaced with lab machine names like "dijkstra" or "pascal" etc.

Notes:
  I'm sure theres something noteworthy I should add here- BUT I DONT REMEMBER!
